how to add angular.jss 
    <script src="angular.js"></scripts>
add ng-app attribute in the html
    <div ng-app></div>
    where this attribute is locate it will apply the angular settings
    functions as abstractions
        we can use a function as a base to pass to angular. We can use that to reuse any kind of functions.
    modules
        its a way to define a function1 that can return a value from a function2 define inside the function1
            var function1 = function(){
                var function2.1 =function(){
                    console.log("some value");
                };
                var function2.2 = function() {
                    console.log=("some other value");
                };
                return{
                    value1:function2.1,
                    value2:function2.2
                };
            }
            function1.value1();// it will sent function2.1 result
            immediately invoked function expression(IIFE)
                One way to avoid global variables is using the IIFE
                    (function(){
                        some code...
                    }());
                    its a function  that has some functions inside of his code that immediatly invokes itself
    Controller
        Its the one who controls all the modules of the application. we need to set the attribute
         ng-controller attribute
         we define this attribute with a name and we get the set of actions it will command
            <div ng-app>
                <div ng-controller ="MainController">
                    <h1>{{message}}</h1
                </div>
            </div>
            so in this light we can assume controllers are mere functions from angular that use a special way to call parameters 
            var MainController = function($scope){
                $scope.message ="Hello";
            };
            the model that we attach to the parameter will go a execute the actions define in our module. Such as sending a message.
            this can be use to change the content of html elements and their attributes too.
